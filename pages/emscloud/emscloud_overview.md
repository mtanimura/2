The EvoStream Media Server is tailored for cloud deployments. Operating a Media Streaming Service in the cloud is great for many reasons: eliminating capital costs, eliminating hardware maintenance cost, immediate deployments, etc… You can do so much with the EvoStream Media Server in the cloud:



## Features

### Content Distribution

Set your content free! Whether you are a Broadcaster, an OTT content provider, or operating a surfing camera website, you will be able to find the right mix of scale and cost to meet your unique needs. Rapidly deploy an online streaming solution in the cloud with the EvoStream Media Server!



### Networked Digital Video Recorder (NDVR/NVR)

Provide access to your customer’s security cameras, action sports cameras, drones and more through an integrated NVR system. Stream live, low-latency, video. Record video and play it back later. Even provide true DVR functionality, allowing users to seek backwards in time during live video playback.



### Content Delivery Network (CDN) Service

Operate your own CDN! Provide a place for users to push their video and build a community around that content. Reach users on any device and on any screen. Monetize with Ad insertion or put premium content behind a paywall.

### Content Monetization
