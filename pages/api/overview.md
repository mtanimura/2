This document describes the Application Programming Interface (API) and Event Notification Systems presented by the EvoStream Media Server (EMS).
The API provides the ability to manipulate the server at runtime. The server can be told to retrieve or create new streams, return information on streams and connections, or even start orstop functional services.  The Event Notification System provides a means for the EMS to alert users of certain events that occur within the EMS, such as a new stream is created, a stream hasbeen dropped, server stopped, etc. The EvoStream Media Server API and Event Notification System allows users to tightly integrate with the server without having to write native plugins or modules.
